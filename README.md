# Rock-Paper-Scissors
React.js (Styling): Rock, Paper, Scissors


In this project, I gave myself the chance to practice my skills in React styling and build consistency with different techniques.

I styled a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. However, rather than sticking to one technique,I modified its appearance using inline styling syntax, object variable syntax, and, CSS modules!

Throughout the project I was able to refresh my memory on the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and practiced React naming conventions for style properties.
